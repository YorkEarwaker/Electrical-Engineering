## Status
TODO
* <todo: consider name change, >
* <todo: consider, hob power supply, 3–10 kW, research COTS products for same, >
* <todo: consider, power efficiency, reduce power consumption, >
* <todo: consider, ideal for resilliency, not grid dependent, attach a battery or other power supply like solar wind, with appropriate electrical saftey circuits, emergency management response, climate refugee camps, damaged infrastructure natural disaster, damaged infrastructure conflict zones, >
* <todo: consider, research induction heating, >
* <todo: consider, research electrodeless lamp, probs not as efficient as LED or similar?, what is most effective low power consumption lighting option, >

DONE
* <done: consdier, intent to commit, >
