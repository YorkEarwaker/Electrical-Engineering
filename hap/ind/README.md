# Induction ind 

Electromagnetic Induction, 


## Notes

Use cases
* Cooking, first class, focus on this in first instance, requires (magnetic) metal cookware, 
* Heating?, air
* Heating, housing, 
* Heating, water, bathing, not for cooking,
* Lighting
* ...

Fossil fuel grid independent, no dependency of fossil fuel grid, 

## Status
TODO
* <todo: consider name change, >
* <todo: consider, hob power supply, 3–10 kW, research COTS products for same, >
* <todo: consider, power efficiency, reduce power consumption, >
* <todo: consider, portable induction hob, ideal for resilliency, not grid dependent, attach a battery or other power supply like solar wind, with appropriate electrical saftey circuits, emergency management response, climate refugee camps, damaged infrastructure natural disaster, damaged infrastructure conflict zones, >
* <todo: consider, research induction heating, >
* <todo: consider, research electrodeless lamp, probs not as efficient as LED or similar?, what is most effective low power consumption lighting option, >

DONE
* <done: consdier, intent to commit, >
