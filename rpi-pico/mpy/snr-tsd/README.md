# Time series data tsd (mpy)

MicroPython for sensor snr for time series data tsd for numerical weather prediction nwp, 

For consumption by climate models for example,

## Goals & Objectives

* Complete sensor reading PoC for open source weather station OSWS project, time series data collection, part of autonomous meteorological network \amn subproject in Climate Model repository

## Status

TODO
* <todo: consider, temperature humidity readings, DHT22 PoC >
* <todo: consider, temperature humidity air pressure readings, BME280 PoC >

DONE
* <done: intent to commit>
