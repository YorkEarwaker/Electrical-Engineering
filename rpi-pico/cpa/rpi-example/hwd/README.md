# Hello world hwd

Auto generated by VSCodium, Raspberry Pi Pico extension, New C/C++ Project, hello world, 

Success! RPi Pico 2 USB device COM, serial connection using PuTTy, 'hello world' text, printf code.

## Notes

VSCode Serial Monitor extension not avialable for VSCodium, 

Successful Run project.

Tracking device serial number D71DEAF4F4F02DEF for reboot
The device was asked to reboot into BOOTSEL mode so the command can be executed.

Family ID 'rp2350-arm-s' can be downloaded in absolute space:
  00000000->02000000
Loading into Flash:   [==============================]  100%

The device was rebooted to start the application.

## Issues

* <issue: can't see 'Serial Monitor', does not appear as tab option on Terminal window, >
* <issue: after reboot Ctrl + Shift + P List Serial Ports, returns; No connected Pico found, >

## Status

TODO
* <todo: consider, PlatformIO extention, serial monitor, VSCode extention only >

DONE
* <done: intent to commit>
* <done: consider, test in VSCode, i.e. is Serial Monitor this only a problem in VSCodium, does not appear to be from Brave searches, . Serial Monitor extension installed in VSCode, was able to view 'hello world' printed from RPi Pico.  >
* <done: consider, PUTTY, serial monitor, installed >
* <done: consider, use PuTTY for serial monitor capability, for use with VSCodium, RPi Pico 2 device COM serial monitor, sucess! hello world>
* <done: consider, Arduino extention, serial monitor, does not appear to support RP2030 i.e. RPi Pico 2 >
