# Raspberry Pi Pico

Microcontroller, IoT, 

## Status

TODO
* <todo: consider, preparetory work for Climate-Model \amn project PoC, >
* <todo: consider, C/C++ book for raspberry pi pico , as it appears Micropython only allows access to a single core of RPi Pico Arm chip, C/C++ allows access to both cores of RPi Pico Arm chip, confirm this is the case! >
* <todo: consider, \cpp or \cee dirctory for c++ and standard c code, likely seperate sub projects,  >
* <todo: consider, wifi connection to RPi Pico 2 W , see datasheet below, try both MicroPython and C/C++ versions, can a Pico flashed with MPY execute c/c++ code too? >

DONE
* <done: intent to commit>
