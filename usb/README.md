# Universal serial bus usb

Inter device communication at a local systems level.

## Status

### TODO
<todo: consider, what are the minimum requirements to start development, >
<todo: consider, as a real world project, serial communication with a RPi Zero as 'headless' >
<todo: consider, ethenet over usb, use RPi Zero as test bed, does RPi Zero have contraits that would disallow this? >

### DONE
<done: consider, intent to commit>
