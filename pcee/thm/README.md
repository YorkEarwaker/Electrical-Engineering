## Notes

Requirements - cooling mechanism, casing/frame, fan, 
* Use case, additive manufacturing, 3d printing
* Use case, recycled plastic, Precious Plastic, com [WS](https://www.preciousplastic.com/), deep concern here with plastics pollution but this technology solution might help to sort and aggregate plastics in bulk for destruction by enzymes, advanced platics degrading enzymes, 
* Use case, tower case fan reuse for external laptop cooler, air movement, 

Assumptions
* external cooling mechanism
* not internal cooling mechanisms

## Status
TODO
* <todo: consider, use case, SSD cooling, external to laptop, interate to include other motherboard pcb components, not laptop model or manufacturer specific so ability to target hotspots on laptop base plate,  >
* <todo: consider, air cooling, external fan box, requires additional energy use, simple>
* <todo: consider, liquid cooling, heat capture and energy transfer, battery pack charing, phone, ear buds, etc, energy feedback, more complex>
* <todo: consider, cooling plate, >

DONE
* <done: consider, intent to commit>
* <done: consider, renaming thermal management thm, from Laptop cooling ltc>

## Hardware

### air cooling - air movement, still air is a very good insulator, 
* fan, one or more coputer fans, >

### liquid cooling - liquid movement, physics; brownian motion? 
* ...

### solid cooling - heat transfer, physics; atomic bonding?
* thermal pad, flexible plyable, micro particle filled silicone or polymer, ceramic filled silicone/polymer, metallic filled silicone/polymer, . micro particles; aluminium oxide, aluminium nitride, boron nitride, magnesium oxide, graphite?
* heatsink, inflexible firm, extruded or machined, metal fins/lattice?
