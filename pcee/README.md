# Personal computing electrical engnineering pcee

Electrical engineering with a laptop or desktop or similar. Interconnection between PC (connector comms host) and diverse hardware devices and systems.

## Notes

Rationale - Two different use cases emerging
* create a pc on a breadboard
* get a pc to interact with breadboard

Question
* Is this reinventing the microcontroller?

PC direct to breadboard
* PC to breadboard power supply, i.e. via connector 'plug' power adaptor
* PC to breadboard comms, i.e. I2C, UART, SPI, GPIO? ...

Access from personal computer PC to breadboard BB by adaptor examples
* USB tranceiver to USB breadboard adapter. 
* UART port with USB to UART converter chip adapter. FTDI FT232RL USB to serial IC
* ...

## Status
TODO
* <todo: consider, BreadBoarding with MS Windows, .exe on Windows interacts with devices attached to breadboard, via USB? >
* <todo: consider, construct a PC on a breadboard, >

DONE
* <done: intent to commit>
