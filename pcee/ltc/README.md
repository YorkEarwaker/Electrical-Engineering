## Notes

Requirements - cooling mechanism, casing/frame, fan, 
* Use case, additive manufacturing, 3d printing
* Use case, recycled plastic, Precious Plastic, com [WS](https://www.preciousplastic.com/), deep concern here with plastics pollution but this technology solution might help to aggregate plastics in bulk for destruction by enzymes, advanced platics degrading enzymes, 
* Use case, tower case fan

Assumptions
* external cooling mechanism
* not internal cooling mechanisms

## Status
TODO
* <todo: consider, air cooling, external fan box, requires additional energy use, simple>
* <todo: consider, liquid cooling, heat capture and energy transfer, battery pack charing, phone, ear buds, etc, energy feedback, more complex>

DONE
* <done: consider, intent to commit>
