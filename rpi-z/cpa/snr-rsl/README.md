# Aerosol sensor snr-rsl (cpa)

* Third attempt at making some progress with the Bosch BMV080 aerosol sensor. 
* First attempt with single board computer RPi Zero 2 W.

* RPi Pico; Aerosol sensor rsl (mpy) [GH](https://github.com/YorkEarwaker/Electrical-Engineering/tree/main/rpi-pi/mpy/snr-rsl), first cut research, start of bare bones MicroPython driver, recognized on Pico I2C bus

## Notes

Assumption
* C/C++ on the RPi Zero 2 W might have less hurdles than on RPi Pico for BMV080 .
* C/C++ on Dell Ubuntu Laptop might have less hurdles than on Dell MS Win 10 Laptop
* MS Win 10 was end of life and out of support and patching
* Target operating systems on RPi Zero 2 W both Debian based distros; RaspiOS Lite Trixie, Ubuntu Core 24, 
* Integration on Dell Ubuntu Laptop to RPi Zero 2 W might has less hurdles as both use Debian Linux distros, 
* RPi Pico 2 W, or other Pico MCU, are not properly supported by Bosch for BMV080 
* RPi Pico 2 W, or other Pico MCU, are not adequately specked for use with Bosch BMV080
* Intent, as progress is made on C/C++ code for BMV080 on RPi Zero 2 W try and cross compile too for RPi Pico 2 W, or other Pico MCU .
