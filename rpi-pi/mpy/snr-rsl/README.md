# Aerosol sensor rsl (mpy)

Aerosol, molecules, particulate matter, air quality control, . The consequence of phase change. The likelyhood of wetbulb events increases. In a warming planet more seven percent more water vapor be held in the atmosphere for each degree of warming. In a warming planet more volatile substance will evaporate. In a warming planet more fires wild and urban will occure and so more particulate matter. The water vapor will compbine with other volative vapor and particulate matter and gases. In one giant chemical experiment in the sky. The chemistry will interact with microorganisms in one giant biological experiment in the sky. Which will interact with the chemistry and biology in oceans and on land and cryosphere. And the increased heat will speed chemical and biochemical molecular interactive process. In one giant  biospheric and geospheric experment in Earths global systems of systems.

Good luck with that. So we need sensors to measure the aerosol things to at least know what is out there and where an in what concentrations with what other things to be able to start to think of how to mitigate the possible consequences. CFC's and the hole in the ozone as one example.
