# Hello world hwd (mpy)

RPi Pico sandpit for first getting started code and content.

First steps in electeical engineering. First steps in MicroPython.

## Status

TODO
* <todo: consider, basic programming techniques in MicroPython, loops, text, numbers, >
* <todo: consider, standard python distribution format, package, use with pipkin for Thonny IDE, from local host, >

DONE
* <done: consider, flash RPi Pico with MicroPython>
* <done: consider, write MicroPython code to execute on RPi Pico >
* <done: consider, first circuit in boradboard with RPi Pico >

## Lib

Package Manager - python package manager, not linux system package manager
* Pipkin, [WS](https://pypi.org/project/pipkin/), Thonny IDE uses this under the hood, to create local packages for RPi Pico MicroPython env, e.g. BYO drivers for periferal devices, sensors, screens,
