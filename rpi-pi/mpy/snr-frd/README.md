# Infrared sensor frd (mpy)

Infrared sensor capability. Radiative energy, heat detection, the likelyhood of phase change. In a warming planet everything will be getting hotter. The gap to biological heat stesss decreases. The likelyhood of wetbulb invents increases. The gap to ignition decreases. The gap to engineering tolernce failure decreases. The gap to vaporisation of volatile substances decreases. The gap to meltinig point decresses. ...
