Rationale

The electromagnetic spectrum energy generated by our star 'Sol' The Sun is the natural radiative forcing mechanism which causes gobal wraming due to anthropogenic emissions of green house gases trapping Sol's radiative energy within Earth's systems e.g. the atmosphere, the oceans, and so on.
